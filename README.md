Apollo is a RESTful API built on Express.js & Typescript.

It's essentially Express.js with Typescript and a couple of out of the box things built for you such as routing, route param data type enforcement, route policies, etc.

See more info at [Apollo Core](https://gitlab.com/apollo-api/core)

## Running tests
