# Apollo API
This is a RESTful API built on Express.js, Typescript, and Webpack.

Apollo is a framework built on top of Express.js and uses Typescript, Babel, and Webpack. It's essentially Express.js with Typescript and a couple of out of the box things built for you (can be swapped out if you opt to not use them)

## Running tests
Easily run tests by running the `make test` command
